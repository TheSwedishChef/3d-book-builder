DEPENDENCIES
------------

- JQuery
- JQuery UI (tabs)




CONCEPT
-------

- 3D book is built & designed using CSS3 & HTML5
- CSS classes are pre-built to accommodate each book design option
- Book design options include cover color, # pages, dimensions, logo, text & gilding
- JQuery is used to watch changes to form elements and tghen apply the corresponding CSS class
- Fluid transitions are built into the CSS to facilitate smooth transitions between design changes
- JQuery is used to rotate the book 'view' from left, center, right and back



DESIGN NOTES
------------

There are lots of really interesting problems that needed solving with this project. In my case, I had a wide range of standard book sizes from 8x8" all the way up to 17x11". This presented a very real problem regarding SCALE: I couldn't scale the books proportionally because, in order to accommodate each size within my container, it meant my smallest size was too small to be usable on-screen. This meant I needed a sliding scale which would allow to scale each size attribute proportionally, but which would still show accurate relative relationships between sizes.

For example, if a user started on 8x8" then switched to a 10x10", I needed to show the book ENLARGING, but I couldn't enlarge by a full, proprtional 2"... but that doesn't matter because the user isn't measuringâ€”they just need the basic visual indication that the book they switched to is indeed larger. So instead of scaling up by 2" in this scenario, I only scaled up by a small portion because STARTING with a large 8x8" book allowed me to take better advantage of the initial available real-estate within my container.

Problems like this persisted, and really challenged my math skills. In the end, I used SASS to define global variables for all of this scaling, and run most of the calculations dynamically using these variables.

On a more simple note, lots of standard VARs were implemented in SASS to globlly control things like the book cover rounded corners, the PNG file used to simulate vertical pages on the spine, the 'thickness' of each inidividual page (used to calculate visual book thickness based on # of pages), and the amount of overhand from the cover to the inside pages. Without a dynamic CSS syntax like SASS, all of this would have been an absolute beast to implement. SASS allowed me to standardize things enough to just barely keep my head around all that was happening.

Additionally, my implementations afforded me prior knowledge of the exact possible combinations for each book: Each book size, gilding color, stamping font, font size, min/max pages per size and leather color were known beforehand and were not likely to change... so I coded that info straight into the SASS, but there's little reason that, COLOR for example, couldn't be arbitrary and set by the user... it will all depend on your application.

As far as debugging, this set of code has NOT been debugged or browser tested. It was developed in Safari, and works in Safari and Chrome.
