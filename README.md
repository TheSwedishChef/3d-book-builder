DEPENDENCIES
------------

- JQuery
- JQuery UI (tabs)




CONCEPT
-------

- 3D book is built & designed using CSS3 & HTML5
- CSS classes are pre-built to accommodate each book design option
- Book design options include cover color, # pages, dimensions, logo, text & gilding
- JQuery is used to watch changes to form elements and tghen apply the corresponding CSS class
- Fluid transitions are built into the CSS to facilitate smooth transitions between design changes
- JQuery is used to rotate the book 'view' from left, center, right and back



DESIGN NOTES
------------

There are lots of really interesting problems that needed solving with this project. In my case, I had a wide range of standard book sizes from 8x8" all the way up to 17x11". This presented a very real problem regarding SCALE: I couldn't scale the books proportionally because, in order to accommodate each size within my container, it meant my smallest size was too small to be usable on-screen. This meant I needed a sliding scale which would allow to scale each size attribute proportionally, but which would still show accurate relative relationships between sizes.

For example, if a user started on 8x8" then switched to a 10x10", I needed to show the book ENLARGING, but I couldn't enlarge by a full, proprtional 2"... but that doesn't matter because the user isn't measuringâ€”they just need the basic visual indication that the book they switched to is indeed larger. So instead of scaling up by 2" in this scenario, I only scaled up by a small portion because STARTING with a large 8x8" book allowed me to take better advantage of the initial available real-estate within my container.

Problems like this persisted, and really challenged my math skills. In the end, I used SASS to define global variables for all of this scaling.
